<h1>Unused Content</h1>

<p>
Soup 0.9 has a rather decent amount of unused content in its files, ranging from unused graphics to music which never made the cut.
</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>

<h3>Day 6, Day 7 and Exit</h3>

<img src="images/mechanics/days.gif" height="300" title="Sprites for the Day Select">

<p>
The game's <a href="dayselect.html">Day Select</a> sheet contains unused sprites for Days 6 and 7, as well as an Exit button.
</p>
<p>
Its likely that the game was supposed to have a full playable week (7 days) instead of 5, as well as an Exit button serving as an another way to leave the game from the menu aside from pressing the Esc key, though this is mere speculation as it was never confirmed.
</p>

<h3>title5.gif</h3>

<img src="images/mechanics/flash/title5.gif" height="300" title="title5.gif">

<p>
A fourth variation of the game's <a href="title.html">Title Cards</a> which never shows up ingame. It has the big green number 10 from the title overlay, though without the japanese text reading "Stereo".
</p>

<h3>tarroom4's Object Variations</h3>

<img src="images/mechanics/unused/chrstop3.bmp" height="128" title="おれ">
<img src="images/mechanics/unused/chrstop4.bmp" height="128" title="おまえ">

<p>
The <a href="tarroom4.html">Telephone Room</a> from <a href="rooms.html#five">Day 5</a> features 3 additional variations of the room's object which go unused.
</p>
<p>
All 4 variations of the object seem to rudely tell the player to stop playing the game for an unknown reason.
</p>
<p>
Its possible that the game would pick one of the 4 versions of the object randomly each time the player entered the room, however once again this was never confirmed, thus remains only a speculation.
</p>

<h3>tarroom1's Additional Overlay</h3>

<img src="images/mechanics/unused/tarroom1's Extra Overlay.bmp" height="300" title="tarroom1's Extra Overlay">

<p>
The <a href="tarroom1.html">Cubic Room</a> from <a href="rooms.html#two">Day 2</a> has an extra, slightly brighter version of its <a href="overlay.html">Overlay</a>. Its difficult to tell what purpose it could have played if it was used.
</p>

<h3>fontchr.bmp</h3>

<img src="images/mechanics/fontchr.bmp" height="128" title="The font used for the FPS Counter">

<p>
The <a href="fpscounter.html" style="color: red">FPS Counter</a> uses this font graphic. However, it only uses the numbers, every other symbol remains unused.
</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<h3>don01</h3>

<p>
don01.ogg is an unused track in the game, none of the rooms use it, the track wind.ogg is used twice instead: by the <a href="donroom5.html">Poem Room</a> and the <a href="takroom0.html">Corrupted Drawing Room</a> from <a href="rooms.html#five">Day 4</a> and <a href="rooms.html#five">Day 5</a> respectively.
</p>

<p>
<audio controls loop>
<source src="music/ogg/don01.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
<source src="music/mp3/don01.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
