<h1>Days</h1>

<p>
<b>Days</b> are a very important part of Soup 0.9's gameplay.
</p>
<p>
As of the latest version of the game (0.91), there are a total of 5 Days, <i>however, there may have been planned to be more.</i>
</p>
<p>
Each Day has 5 <a href="rooms.html">Rooms</a> the player can walk around in, which in total is 25 rooms in the whole game.
</p>
<p>
Completing a Day will either bring up the <a href="oyasuminasai.html">Oyasuminasai Screen</a> or the <a href="dayselect.html">Day Select</a> based on the player's save data number.
</p>
<p>
It seems that originally there were going to be 7 days in the game, judging by graphics for Days 6 and 7, as well as an Exit button, being on the <a href="dayselect.html">Day Select</a> sprite sheet. It is unknown why the last 2 Days were scrapped.
