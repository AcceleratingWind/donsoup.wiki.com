<p>
<b>Soup Soup</b> is a mod for Soup 0.9, made by a group of people led by Kite Line. It was released on October 4th, 2022.
</p>
<p>
The mod is a little bit more creepier and unsettling than the original game, with some humor and references put into the mixture.
</p>
<p>
Internally, most of the files' names have not changed. However, there is a separate document named "soapsoup", in a similar fashion to the original "soup" and "soup.en" documents which remain untouched. The save data is set as 777 by default, so you already get access to the <a href="dayselect.html">Day Select</a>.
</p>
<p>
Some differences include Days being named Nights and the rooms having official names, listed in "soapsoup" document mentioned above.
