<h1>Movement</h1>

<p>
Soup 0.9 has a pretty unique <b>movement system</b>, in terms of both player movement and camera movement.
</p>
<p>
Moving the camera is done with the arrow keys (and also the WASD keys as of version 0.91).
</p>
<p>
There is no limit to how far you can move the camera left or right, or even up and down, which allows the player to go upside down.
</p>
<p>
A "breathing" animation plays whenever the player isn't moving, and a small window image appears after some time of standing still, reminding the player of the game's controls.
</p>
<p>
To move, you have to hold shift and then use the keys mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
As you move, you can hear your <a href="footsteps.html">footsteps</a> which vary on the room you're in.
