<p>
<b>absinthe</b> is a fangame of Soup 0.9, made by yoka in Unity. It was released on May 15th, 2021.
</p>
<p>
The fangame's rooms vary in content and the vibes they give off, but they are usually pretty tame compared to the original game.
</p>
<p>
Many rooms also seem to have more going on in them, having various other objects be in a single room, rather than simply being largely empty closed spaces with textures for the walls and the floor.
</p>
<p>
You don't have to hold shift to walk and the camera is controlled with the mouse. You touch the walls of the room you're in to go to a different (seemingly random) one, which happens pretty much instantly with no transition. There isn't a Day system, you simply go around various rooms.
</p>
<p>
At the moment, the game hasn't been updated since release. The creator has stated that they would like to make an update, but they have been too busy to start.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
The fangame can be downloaded on yoka's website <a href="https://yoka.red/etc/absinthe/download.html">here</a>.
